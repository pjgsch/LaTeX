# LaTeX

<pre>

This is a repository for use with LaTeX on your local computer.
You have to use a 'bash'-shell.
Also, obviously, you must have 'latex' installed, including
'xdvi', 'dvips' and 'ps2pdf', which is a ghostscript shortcut;
'pdflatex' is optional.
Some style-files may be missing on your local machine and have to
be installed (or ignored).

In this repository you will find :

  style files              in 'tex/' 
  template files           in 'tex/tpl/' 
  some documentation       in 'tex/doc/'

In the root diretory you find the script files 'texini.sh'
and 'textry.sh'.

Extract the zip-file 'LaTeX-main.zip' in some directory on your
local machine and go into 'LaTeX-main'.

Open 'texini.sh' in an editor and adapt for your situation.
Open 'textry.sh' and select an example.
Run 'textry.sh' and see what happens.
Hopefully you end up with a file 'tex.ps' and/or 'tex.pdf', which 
you can view in a document viewer.

You may have noticed that there are macro's defined to facilitate
the typesetting.
An example: 'texmac.sty', 'texmac0.sty' and 'texmac00.sty' define
much, lesser and the least macro's for my purposes.
The macro's in 'texfig.sty' and 'texfig0.sty' define the location
of figures, which, on my laptop at least, were located in various
directories.


Succes and have fun.
