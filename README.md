# LaTeX

<pre>

This is a repository for use with LaTeX on your local computer.
You have to use a 'bash'-shell.
Also, obviously, you must have 'latex' installed, including
'xdvi', 'dvips' and 'ps2pdf', which is a ghostscript shortcut;
'pdflatex' is optional.
Some style-files may be missing on your local machine and have to
be installed (or ignored).

In this repository you will find :

  style files              in 'tex/' 
  template files           in 'tex/tpl' 
  some documentation       in 'tex/doc/'

In the root diretory you find the script files 'texini.sh'
and 'textry.sh'.

Extract the zip-file 'LaTeX-main.zip' in some directory on your
local machine and go into 'LaTeX-main'.

Open 'texini.sh' in an editor and adapt for your situation.
Open 'textry.sh' and select an example.
Run 'textry.sh' and see what happens.
Hopefully you end up with a file 'tex.ps' and/or 'tex.pdf', which 
you can view in a document viewer.

Succes and have fun.
